Business Domain: Inventory Management System for Warehouse
Brief about system:
An Inventory Management System is a software solution designed to efficiently track and control a company's inventory of goods. It works by maintaining a real-time database of product information, including stock levels, item descriptions, and supplier details. When inventory is received, the system updates its records, and when items are sold or used, it deducts them from the inventory. This ensures that businesses have a clear view of their stock levels at all times.

Working on this project provides a comprehensive learning experience in software development, user interface design, and data analysis. An Inventory Management System for Warehouses provides an opportunity to work on real-world software development challenges, such as designing a database schema for efficient data storage, implementing algorithms for demand forecasting, and creating a user-friendly interface for inventory monitoring.
